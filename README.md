# MS Dataset Specifications - Publicly Available Datasets

This folder contains multiple files comprising datasets related to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for research and analysis purposes.

## File 1:
Contains data on 60 different patients, each with 3 MRI sequences: FLAIR, T1, and T3. This file does not include information about MS subgroups. For more detailed patient information, please refer to the 'Supplementary Table 1 for patient info .xlsx' file.

## File 2:
### From: MS Longitudinal Challenge Data Set - Image Analysis and Communications Lab (IACL) / Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Hospital
This file includes two sub-files: one for training and one for testing, comprising:
- Training data (5 subjects each) with MRI sequences: mprage, flair, t1/t2, pd, containing RRMS (4) and PPMS (1) data.
- Testing data (14 subjects each) with MRI sequences: mprage, flair, t1/t2, pd, containing RRMS (12), SP (1), and PP (1) data.
**Important note:** Usage of algorithms from this challenge requires proper citation, as mentioned in the acknowledgment section below.

## File 3:
